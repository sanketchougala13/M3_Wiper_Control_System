 * The main focus point is seeing the wiper control of the car.
 * And also seeing the seep of the wiper system in the car
 * Now this two features are explained in these project

## 5W's & 1H and S.W.O.T analysis is in the below table 

# | 5W's & 1H | 
*__What__   
-- wiper control system (WCS) 

*__Where__ 
--Inside and out side the car

--By using STM like by multiple pushes on a button

# | S.W.O.T ANALYSIS | 

__Strengths__ 

* No human interaction with car
* Manages all commands with one key automatically
* encryption in data
__Weaknesses__

* Unable to monitor status of car
* Range is limited
* Wait for certain time after every command to press new command 
__Opportunities__

* The Scope of this sytem is huge in car control
* can be used where  the car need thesed command
* Less cost
__Threats__

* When new command is given without completing the current command it will not take current command
