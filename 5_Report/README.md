# REQUIREMENTS
## i Description
 * This Project is an __Wiper control (WCS) system__,a wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.It useful in the automotive unit the main purpose of the system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.

---

## ii Identifying features
 * When the button is pressed once the car will start (__Ignition key postion at ACC__)
 * When the button is pressed again the wiper will start(__Wiper On__)
 * When the button is pressed again the wiper will off(__Wiper Off__)
 * When the button is pressed thrice the car will stop(__Ignition key position at Lock__)

## iii State of art
 * The main focus point is seeing the wiper control of the car.
 * And also seeing the seep of the wiper system in the car
 * Now this two features are explained in these project
---
## iv 5W's & 1H and S.W.O.T analysis is in the below table 

| 5W's & 1H | 

*__What__  -- wiper control system (WCS)

*__Where__ --Inside and out side the car

*__When__  --When the weather condition is bad (like in rain and snow) the wiper is activate and clean the car window

*__Who__   --Who is driving or controlling the car

*__How__   --By using STM like by multiple pushes on a button


| S.W.O.T ANALYSIS |

__Strengths__ 

*No human interaction with car

*Manages all commands with one key automatically

*encryption in data

__Weaknesses__

*Unable to monitor status of car

*Range is limited

*Wait for certain time after every command to press new command 

__Opportunities__

*The Scope of this sytem is huge in car control

*can be used where  the car need thesed command

*Less cost

__Threats__

*When new command is given without completing the current command it will not take current command
